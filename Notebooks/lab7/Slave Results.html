TREASURY'S BAKER NOT CONCERNED BY BOND DECLINES

    WASHINGTON, March 31 - Treasury Secretary James Baker,

asked whether he was concerned about yesterdays precipitous

decline in bond prices, said he was not.

    Questioned by reporters as he left a House committee

hearing, Baker said "no," when asked about the bond decline,

adding that it was a reflection of concern about the

possibility of a trade war.

    "It is what the markets think would be the adverse

consequences of a trade war."

    He said the administration was concerned that protectionism

would lead to international trade problems adding that he

thought the action against the Japanese was still consistent

with this policy.

UAW SAYS MAJOR WORK STOPPAGE POSSIBLE AT GM, FORD

    By Richard Walker, Reuters

    CHICAGO, April 13 - Leaders of the nation's unionized

automobile workers have signaled their intent for a major work

stoppage later this year if General Motors Corp. &lt;GM&gt; and Ford

Motor Co. &lt;F&gt;  fail to satisfy demands for job security, pay

raises and protection against shifting U.S. production to

foreign sources.

    United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Owen Bieber was

loudly cheered by some 3,000 local delegates at a special

bargaining strategy convention yesterday when he declared the

1.1 mln-member union is ready to go to "war" against the major

auto makers in support of its goals.

    "It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ...

and if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against the

insecurity of layoff," the UAW chief said.

HUSSEIN SAYS IRAN'S YEAR OF DECISIVENESS FOILED

    BAGHDAD, March 22 - President Saddam Hussein said Iraq had

foiled Iran's promise of a decisive victory in their war but

acknowledged the latest fighting cost his nation higher losses

than previous battles.

    Hussein warned his frontline troops to expect further

Iranian attacks to spoil celebrations being organised

throughout Iraq to mark what Baghdad has hailed as the failure

of Iran's so-called year of decisiveness.

    Iran's leadership had pledged a decisive breakthrough in

the 6-1/2-year-long war in the Persian year -- which ended

yesterday -- and mounted a major offensive towards Iraq's

second city of Basra, on the southern front, in January.

    Iraq has never given any casualty figures but Hussein

conceded they were high.

IRAN SAYS IT OPENS NEW OFFENSIVE NORTH OF BAGHDAD

    LONDON, April 9 - Iran said it launched a fresh offensive

today north of Baghdad, three days after it began a new thrust

against Iraq on the southern Gulf war front.

    The Iranian news agency IRNA, received in London, said the

offensive began before dawn northeast of Qasr-e-Shirin, on the

border 110 miles northeast of the Iraqi capital.

    "Heavy casualties and losses have been inflicted on Iraqi

forces in the fresh Iranian assault," IRNA said.

    Iran today reported major gains on the southern front near

the major Iraqi port city of Basra, saying its forces had

captured an important defensive line.

    Iraq said today it repelled an Iranian assault near its

southern port of Basra last night, inflicting thousands of

casualties on the attackers.

CANADA SEES GLOBAL ACTION TO REDUCE FARM SUBSIDY

    SINGAPORE, June 18 - Canada's Foreign Minister Joe Clark

said there is greater international recognition on the need to

reduce government-imposed subsidies on agricultural produce.

    "There is now recognition that agricultural subsidies must

be reduced, and other reform measures pursued," Clark told a

conference of ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations)

foreign ministers and their counterparts from six

industrialised countries.

    A delegate said Clark's call for "halting the subsidy war in

the agricultural products" to ensure a stable world trading

system received warm support from Japan and Australia.

    Clark said the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and

Development (OECD) has called for "reduction of direct and

indirect subsidies and avoidance of predatory or protectionist

HOUSE COMMITTEE SLASHES "STAR WARS" FUNDING

    WASHINGTON, April 7 - The House Armed Services Committee

slashed President Reagan's funding request for the Strategic

Defense Initiative (SDI), approving 1.7 billion dlrs less than

he had proposed for the anti-missile program.

    The committee, during its consideration of the 1988 defense

authorization bill, also cut by more than half Reagan's request

for a rail system for strategic missiles.

    The proposals must be adopted by the full House and Senate

before becoming law.

    The committee approved 3.5 billion dlrs for SDI, a land-

and space-based anti-missile defense program commonly known as

"Star Wars." The amount was 1.7 billion dlrs less than the

administration request of 5.2 billion dlrs.

    The Reagan administration has requested a total of 312

billion dlrs for defense in 1988, but congressional leaders

LEBANESE PRESIDENT AGREES NEW PEACE MOVES

    BEIRUT, March 2 - Lebanese President Amin Gemayel has

agreed to three key points in a new Syrian-brokered plan aimed

at ending civil war in Lebanon, official sources said.

    They said the Maronite Christian leader has agreed to give

up Cabinet voting rights, to ensure that the Prime Minister is

elected by parliament and to the abolition in principle of

Lebanon's current power-sharing system.

    Gemayel had agreed to the proposals in two months of

indirect negotiations with Syrian leaders, the sources said.
